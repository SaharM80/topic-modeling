This morning police need your help finding the group behind a string of violent robberies in the Bronx. Investigators are looking for the five suspects you see in these surveillance images. And they say two of the incidents happened just minutes apart on August 18. The first near Olenville Avenue and Waits Place. That's where five people beat a man before stealing his iPhone. Five minutes later, just before midnight, the same group attacked a 47 year old man on Brocks Park East, stealing his backpack. And police say in a third robbery on August 29 at the same location, the suspects robbed a man at gunpoint, beating him and stealing his cell phone.  \n","1                                                                                                                                                                         a call. San Francisco firefighters rescued a man right near the Cliff house. They say he fell over this ledge here early this morning. If you're not familiar with the area, this is kind of just north end of Ocean Beach. You could see the firefighters. They're able to use their ropes and pull that man up about 20ft from the cement barrier down below. Now they say it could have been much worse.
